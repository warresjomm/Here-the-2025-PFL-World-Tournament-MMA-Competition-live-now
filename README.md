2025 PFL World Tournament – A New Era In MMA Competition
The year is 2025, and the Professional Fighters League (PFL) has launched its most ambitious season yet, ushering MMA into a new era of tournament-based competition. The 2025 PFL World Tournament features a new, staggering international roster and a shortcut to championship glory and is gaining traction with fight fans worldwide. A Tournament Like No OtherUnlike other M.M.A. promotions, the P.F.L.’s “win and advance” single-elimination format is one of a kind. And this year the league expanded its tournament to four more divisions, spanning eight weight classes: Heavyweight, Light Heavyweight, Middleweight, Welterweight, Lightweight, Featherweight, Bantamweight and Women’s Flyweight. Sixty-four of the planet’s most elite fighters will compete over five months in pursuit of the ultimate prize, in brackets of eight world-class competitors. The action started on April 3 in Universal Studios Florida in Orlando with opening round action for both welterweights and featherweights. More first-round events follow on April 11, April 18 and May 1, with semifinals in June and finals in three major U.S. cities in August. Key Changes for 2025There are several significant changes for the season:Prize Money: A champion in each division will still earn $500,000 for winning, but that's down from $1 million, and the tournament’s total purse remains mind-blowing at $20 million. Format: Bye-bye, regular-season points system. The new single-elimination bracket means that every fight is do-or-die — lose and you’re out. Fight rules: All fights can use elbows now; the finals will be five five-minute rounds, while earlier rounds will remain three rounds of five minutes. Global Broadcast: PFL 2025 World Tournament will be broadcast live on the ESPN networks in the U.S., DAZN in Europe and streamed in 190 countries worldwide. Who to Watch: Stars and StorylinesThe lightweight bracket features an abundance of name value with 2024 PFL champion Gadzh Rabadanov taking on former Bellator spoiler Brent Primus and fan-favorite Clay Collard. Primus, 40, brings veteran savvy and big-fight experience that could make him a candidate to upset a field that lacks an obvious favorite. His road was made slightly easier when his opponent was switched late, but every bracket is packed with talented competitors and an upset is never out of the question. There are big names in the welterweight division, too, with former Bellator titleholder Jason Jackson already making waves by taking out Andrey Koreshkov in Round 1 of their matchup. The featherweight bracket holds its fair share of fireworks as well, with a trilogy bout between 2023 PFL champ Jesus Pinedo and Gabriel Braga in the semifinals.
